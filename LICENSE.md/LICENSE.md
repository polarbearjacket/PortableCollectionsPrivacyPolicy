General context

This app was written as a hobby project. 
The developer is not interested in running ads or collecting and selling data, so it is designed not to do that.
This is a very simple app that only stores data on the device itself.


Information Collection and Use

This app only collects data that the user actively chooses to collect through the the app.
That information is restricted to the camera pictures, images and text that are added as a direct result of a user's action within this app.

The app does not upload any data to any server anywhere. The data used by the app is only stored on the device and its internal storage devices. This also means that in case of loss or malfunction of hardware or software, the data that was stored in this app might be lost. The developer can not be held responsible for such situations or any damage that might be caused by that.

If a stored graphic image is added as content to the app, actually a new copy of that image is created and stored in the app. This means that the original graphic image remains unchanged, even if the app is removed.

If a camera picture is newly created through this app and added as content to the app, the camera picture is only added to the app and not to the Gallery. This means that camera pictures that were created through this app will be removed if the app is removed and other (normal) camera pictures taken outside the app, are not affected by removal of this app.
