This app can be used to add camera pictures and previously stored images to the app, along with some text that is entered within the app itself. 

If a camera picture is newly created through the use of this app, the new picture is stored only within the container of this app so it would be removed if the app would ever be removed.

If an image that was previously stored on the device by any way outside this app, is added as an image within the app, only a copy of that original is stored in the app. The original image will never be changed, modified or removed by the app, not even if the app itself is removed.

The developer in no way has access to the data of the user, either within or outside the usage of the app. The developer is in no way interested in that data either.

The developer can not help to restore any lost data that results from the loss of a device, an SD card or from removal of the app.
